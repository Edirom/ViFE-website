[Edirom-Online](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online) is a software for presenting and analyzing critical musical editions in a digital format, particularly in **musicology** and **philology**. It supports various data formats commonly used in digital humanities, such as **TEI** (Text Encoding Initiative) for textual data and **MEI** (Music Encoding Initiative) for musical data, visualized with **Verovio**. This enables integration of different data formats, initially including texts, images, and music, and later expanding to audio and film within a single edition.

#### Goal
The main goal of this project is to **build a knowledge graph** for the data 
formats supported by Edirom-Online to improve **interoperability** and 
ensure **data consistency**. 
It will also serve as a foundation for **future linked data projects**. 
This can be achieved by:

- Using **graph query technologies**.
- Constructing an **ontology** based on existing vocabularies, such as **Dublin Core** and **DICT**.
- Establishing a **structured and standardized ontology** to enhance **data consistency** across other projects using Edirom-Online.
- Supporting **internationalization** efforts of Edirom-Online.

#### Impact
This project will be a **milestone** for Edirom-Online as it will introduce its first **consistent data structure** and **shareable resources**. Improving **interoperability** and **accessibility** will also contribute to the **internationalization** of the software.

#### Warm-up Tasks
To get started with this project, complete the following tasks:

1. **Read the documentation** for Edirom-Online:

2. **Familiarize yourself with issues** in Edirom-Online:  
   - [Edirom-Online Issues](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online/issues)

3. **Learn about building ontologies and linked data:**  
   - [OWL (Web Ontology Language)](https://www.w3.org/OWL/)  
   - [Introduction to Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkedData)  
   - [SPARQL 1.1 Query Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)
