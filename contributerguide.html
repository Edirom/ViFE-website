      <h2>Contributor's Guide: Writing a Proposal</h2>
      <h3>Understand the Organization</h3>
      <p>
      Virtual Research Network Edirom (ViFE) is an association of current and former employees of the Detmold/Paderborn Department of Musicology who are involved in various projects dealing with the application of digital methods in musicology. The common goal is to promote digital work in the field of musicological research, in particular digital text and music editions. ViFE organizes the annual Edirom Summer School.

      The network is named after the DFG project for the development of tools for digital forms of scholarly-critical music editions (2006-2012), which became known as “Edirom” and formed the starting point for a series of other digital projects.
      
      The focus of the network's national and international work is on the conception of digital editions and their forms of publication, the application and further development of relevant standards (TEI, MEI) and tools, questions of data modelling and project organization, the promotion of communication between digitally working projects and institutions and the transfer of relevant knowledge and skills. The network partners are working together to develop skills in these areas in order to be available as contacts for the new digital community.
